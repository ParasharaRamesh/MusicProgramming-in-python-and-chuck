the code generating the song is in the file "final.ck" and all the various segments of the song are coded in other ".ck" files.
the code requires few .wav files from these folders "SampleMelody" and "SampleRhythm" which can be downloaded from this link "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Smeburh34Io6amtEcI2j2s9Do69R6g-L"
this is in a language called "chuck". enjoy:)
