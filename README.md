I.)the file "CarnaticExperiment.py" tries to play the raaga scala given the melakarta number and also "sorts" a given phrase of notes in a particular raaga using various sorting algorithms by playing the phrase at each iteration of sorting, so the user can "musically" listen to how sorting happens at each iteration and at the final iteration the phrase will be in its ascending scale i.e "aarohanam"

II.)this is a link to my soundcloud profile where I have uploaded both the songs I have coded here.
"https://soundcloud.com/user-966705949"
Some of the recordings for these songs were taken from my phone where I recorded the flute segments for my song so the quality of recording might not sound great.

Anyways
:)enjoy
