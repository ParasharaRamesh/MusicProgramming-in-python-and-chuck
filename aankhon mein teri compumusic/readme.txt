hey everyone!
"main.ck" is the main code which stitches the song .
the song is recorded is made up of 4 segments reused throughout the song.
each segment was played on the flute by me :) and savedd as ".wav" files
you can run the code and save it as .wav file or you can listen to this song on my soundcloud account(link attached in the readme file in the repo)
